#ifndef ByteMessage_h
#define ByteMessage_h

#include <stdint.h> // needed for fixed-size data types
#include <stddef.h> // needed for size_t data type

/* Note: This header file also includes the complete implementation from ByteMessage.hpp! */

/* 
 * Important points:
 *  - SIZE and TYPE are both template parameters
 * - type and size() are implemented as static constexpr class members
 * - all functions are implemented within this header file (by including ByteMessage.hpp)
 * - We do NOT derive from a common base class because this has no advantages:
 *   We do a *composition* with ByteMessageFields, thus we cannot access member
 *   variables in derived classes from pointers of base classes.
 * - The copy constructor only copies the array.
 * - The assignment operator does nothing. Members in derived classes
 *   are responsible for data copies.
